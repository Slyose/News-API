# Northcoders News API

## Background

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

In order to successfully connect to the two databases locally, .env. files must be created containing the name of the database you wish to connect to.
